# Cinch Protocol

We believe two things need to be true to onboard the next billion users into web3:

- It will be done via mobile and through apps 
- It will be a collective effort among industry stakeholders

We built Cinch Protocol to manage the integration and fee sharing between non-custodial wallet providers and DeFi protocols. 

Our goal is to put amazing DeFi products in front of millions of users. Non-custodial wallets are the user facing interface. DeFi protocols are the products. Cinch Protocol is the infrastructure that connects the two.
